# kong-dev-ai-assistant
A Lua-only, agentic AI plugin which transforms your Kong API Gateway into a Developer AI Assistant. It intercepts requests to a dedicated /ai-assist endpoint, processes developer queries using a large language model (LLM), and dynamically  executes Lua-based tools to provide structured, actionable insights about your APIs, services, and traffic.
